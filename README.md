# THE **XCHEME™** COMPILER

An XML to S-Expressions translator built with the XSLT W3C Technology for the **Xcheme™** functionnal programming language.

## About this project

The **Xcheme™** project's goal is to provide a powerful Web technology combining the expressiveness of the XML programming language with the efficiency of XSLT compilation. The result is an astonishingly portable programming language that can be used in conjunction with most of the modern LISP compilers/interpreters.
